* jsp life cycle

1.trasalation -> jsp to servelet
2.compilation -> servlet to .class file
3.loading -> .class file load on server and object is creaated
4.initialization -> [jspInit] object will initialize
5.request handling -> _jspsrvice() method or do get() or do post() method will execute and handle the client request
6.destroy -> jsp will destroy

* Servlet life cycle

1.loading ->  when server is started class will load into memory and servlet object is created (happens only once)
2.initialization -> servlet object will initilized by invoking init() method (happens only once)
3.request handling ->  the client request will handle as per request service() method call the methods like doPost() or doGet() (every time new thred will created for handle the client request)
4.destroy -> when the server will shut down then destroy() method will call and servlet object will delete

* Serialization 

Serialization in Java refers to the process of converting an object's state (its fields and data) into a byte stream, 
which can be easily stored in a file or transmitted over a network. This byte stream can later be deserialized, converting it back into an object with the same state. 
Serialization is commonly used for tasks such as object persistence (saving and loading objects), data storage, and inter-process communication.
In Java, the java.io.Serializable interface is used to indicate that a class can be serialized. When a class implements the Serializable interface, 
it tells the Java runtime that objects of that class can be converted to a byte stream.

*what is api andd rest api

 api mean application programming interface. it is a one type of messenger who transfer the data from one place to another plave
 In Java, API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is a set of rules and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. 
 It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. Java itself provides a vast standard API as part of the Java Development Kit (JDK),
 and developers often refer to this as the Java API.

* Library and Framework APIs:
Java developers often work with libraries and frameworks that provide their own APIs. For example, the Spring Framework has its own API for handling dependency injection, 
AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming), and more.

* Creating Your Own API:
When you develop software, you can create your own APIs to define the interactions between different components of your application. 
This involves creating classes and interfaces that specify how other parts of your program can interact with a particular module or service.

* diff between controller and rest controller

Controller:
A regular controller in Spring is typically used to handle traditional web requests and responses.
It is responsible for processing user input, invoking the business logic, and returning an appropriate view as a response.
Controllers in Spring can handle various types of views, including HTML, XML, JSON, etc.
They are often associated with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, where the controller manages the flow of data between the model (business logic) and the view (presentation).

RestController:
A RestController in Spring is a specialized version of a controller that is used to build RESTful web services.
It is specifically designed for scenarios where the client (typically a frontend application or another service) expects data in a format like JSON or XML rather than HTML.
The methods in a RestController are annotated with @RequestMapping or @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc., to map HTTP methods to specific functionalities.
The data returned by a RestController is usually the raw data (like JSON) rather than a view. Spring automatically converts the data into the requested format.

* which is option for hibernate
* what is comparatore and comparable

Comparable Interface:
The Comparable it is a functional interface is part of the Java API and is in the java.lang package.
When a class implements the Comparable interface, it means that instances (object) of that class can be compared with each other.
The Comparable interface defines a method called compareTo(Object obj) only one object that needs to be implemented by the class. This method compares the current object with the specified object and returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer 
Classes that implement Comparable can be sorted using the natural ordering imposed by the compareTo method.

Comparator Interface:
The Comparator interface is also functional interface andd part of the Java API and is in the java.util package.
It provides a way to define custom comparison logic for objects that may not have a natural ordering or when you want to override the natural ordering.
The Comparator interface defines a method called compare(T o1, T o2) that compares two objects for order its return a integer value.
You can create instances of Comparator and use them to sort collections or arrays.

* diff bet jdbc and hibernate
JDBC
-In JDBC, one needs to write code to map the object model's data representation to the schema of the relational model.
-JDBC enables developers to create queries and update data to a relational database using the Structured Query
Language (SQL).
-JDBC code needs to be written in a try-catch databases block as it throws checked exceptions (SQLexception).
-JDBC is database dependent i.e. one needs to write different codes for different database.
-Creating associations between relations is quite hard in
JDBC.
-It is a database connectivity tool.
-Lazy Loading is not supported.
-It has low performance than Hibernate.
-One needs to maintain explicitly database connections and transactions.
-It has a dedicated customer support service system.

Hibernate
-maps the obiect model's data to the schema of the database itself with the help of annotations.
-Hibernate uses HQL (Hibernate Query Language) which is similar to SQL but understands object-oriented concepts like inheritance, association etc.
-Whereas Hibernate manages the exceptions itself by marking them as unchecked.
-Whereas Hibernate is database-independent and the same code can work for many databases with minor changes.
-Associations like one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many can be acquired easily with the help of annotations.
-It is a Java framework.
-Lazy Loading is supported.
-It has high performance.
-It itself manages its own transactions.
-Waiting time is more for any answer to an issue.

* what is componant
In the Spring Boot, a "component" typically refers to a class annotated with @Component or one of its specialized variants, such as @Service, @Repository, or @Controller. 
These annotations are part of the Spring Framework and are used for declaring and autodetecting Spring beans.
 A Spring bean is a Java object managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. 
Components are one of the ways to define and register beans in a Spring application.
e.g
@Service: This annotation is used to indicate that a class is a service component. It is often used for service layer classes in a Spring application.
@Service
public class MyService {
    // Class definition
}
